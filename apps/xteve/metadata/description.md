## M3U Proxy for Plex DVR and Emby Live TV

xTeVe is a M3U proxy server for Plex, Emby and any client and provider which supports the .TS and .M3U8 (HLS) streaming formats. xTeVe emulates a SiliconDust HDHomeRun OTA tuner, which allows it to expose IPTV style channels to software, which would not normally support it.
